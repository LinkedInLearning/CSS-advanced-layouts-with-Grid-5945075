      <h2>A shifting reef</h2>
      <p>The year 1866 was signalised by a remarkable incident, a mysterious and puzzling phenomenon, which doubtless no
        one has
        yet forgotten. Not to mention rumours which agitated the maritime population and excited the public mind, even
        in the
        interior of continents, seafaring men were particularly excited. Merchants, common sailors, captains of vessels,
        skippers, both of Europe and America, naval officers of all countries, and the Governments of several states on
        the two
        continents, were deeply interested in the matter.</p>

      <p>For some time past, vessels had been met by “an enormous thing,” a long object, spindle-shaped, occasionally
        phosphorescent, and infinitely larger and more rapid in its movements than a whale.</p>

      <p>The facts relating to this apparition (entered in various log-books) agreed in most respects as to the shape of
        the
        object or creature in question, the untiring rapidity of its movements, its surprising power of locomotion, and
        the
        peculiar life with which it seemed endowed. If it was a cetacean, it surpassed in size all those hitherto
        classified in
        science. Taking into consideration the mean of observations made at divers times,—rejecting the timid estimate
        of those
        who assigned to this object a length of two hundred feet, equally with the exaggerated opinions which set it
        down as a
        mile in width and three in length,—we might fairly conclude that this mysterious being surpassed greatly all
        dimensions
        admitted by the ichthyologists of the day, if it existed at all. And that it did exist was an undeniable fact;
        and, with
        that tendency which disposes the human mind in favour of the marvellous, we can understand the excitement
        produced in
        the entire world by this supernatural apparition. As to classing it in the list of fables, the idea was out of
        the
        question.</p>
