          <h2>A Shifting Reef</h2>
          <p>The year 1866 was signalised by a remarkable incident, a mysterious and puzzling phenomenon, which
            doubtless no one has yet forgotten. Not to mention rumours which agitated the maritime population and
            excited the public mind, even in the interior of continents, seafaring men were particularly excited.
            Merchants, common sailors, captains of vessels, skippers, both of Europe and America, naval officers of all
            countries, and the Governments of several states on the two continents, were deeply interested in the
            matter.</p>

            <h2>I Form My Resolution</h2>
            <p>Three seconds before the arrival of J. B. Hobson’s letter, I no more
              thought of pursuing the unicorn than of attempting the passage of the
              North Sea. Three seconds after reading the letter of the honourable
              Secretary of Marine, I felt that my true vocation, the sole end of my
              life, was to chase this disturbing monster, and purge it from the
              world.</p>

            <h2>The Man of the Seas</h2>
            <p>It was the commander of the vessel who thus spoke. At these words, Ned Land rose suddenly. The steward,
              nearly strangled, tottered out on a sign from his master; but such was the power of the commander on
              board, that not a gesture betrayed the resentment which this man must have felt towards the Canadian.</p>

            <h2>At Full Steam</h2>
            <p>At this cry the whole ship’s crew hurried towards the harpooner,—commander, officers, masters, sailors,
              cabin boys; even the engineers left their engines, and the stokers their furnaces.
              The order to stop her had been given, and the frigate now simply went on by her own momentum.</p>

          <p>Ned Land was a Canadian, with an uncommon quickness of hand, and who knew no equal in his dangerous
            occupation. Skill, coolness, audacity, and cunning he possessed in a superior degree, and it must be a
            cunning whale or a singularly “cute” cachalot to escape the stroke of his harpoon.</p>

          <h2>Ned Land</h2>
          <p>Captain Farragut was a good seaman, worthy of the frigate he commanded. His vessel and he were one. He was
            the soul of it. On the question of the cetacean there was no doubt in his mind, and he would not allow the
            existence of the animal to be disputed on board. </p>

          <h2>At a Venture</h2>
          <p>Commander Farragut, desirous of seeing Ned Land at work, gave him permission to go on board the Monroe. And
            fate served our Canadian so well that, instead of one whale, he harpooned two with a double blow, striking
            one straight to the heart, and catching the other after some minutes’ pursuit.
